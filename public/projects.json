My first big project was a unique parallax design, different from the usual website scrolling effects, and it gave me a strong base for later projects. This experience led me to my next piece: an intro bumper for my sports guide branding. For this project, I experimented a lot with After Effects filters, basic design principles, and using null objects. I found After Effects so engaging; hours would pass without me noticing because it was so much fun and a good creative challenge. I'm excited to keep making my workflow better and unlock all the creative things I can do in After Effects.",

    "shortDescription": "Designed and prototyped 'J-Sports Cards,' an app concept that transforms personal sports photos into customizable digital trading cards. It features sport-specific stats and an intuitive UI, aiming to fill a market gap for multi-sport data tracking.",
    "longDescription": "J-Sports Cards began as a personal idea addressing a real-world problem and a gap in the current market. This app concept is designed to turn pictures on your phone into customizable trading card-style formats, which can then be downloaded or printed. Its unique strength lies in its adaptability: it can apply to any sport or activity. The app easily lays out and makes available sport-specific statsâ€”goals and assists for hockey, home runs or strikeouts for baseball, and so on for various sports. Having one app that manages all sports is a novel concept not currently available. In today's competitive world, tracking data is something even children enjoy, sometimes without realizing it. An easy and simplified user interface allows anyone, from amateur to professional, to customize what they see on their card. If a beginner didn't get any points, that wouldn't be posted. However, if an advanced player broke a new personal record, that would definitely be on the back of the card. An intuitive system that applies to all different player types is key to this app's success. Real user research was conducted, including journey mapping and personas. Based on this information, wireframes were created and developed into a functional prototype. The exciting next step will be developing an MVP version of the app. As my education continues at the time of writing this, I am fortunate to have opportunities to bring my imagination to life.",
