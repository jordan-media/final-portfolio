The extra time on two wheels and the wind blowing on my face is better in every way I can think of right now.\n\nI‚Äôve got some mellow tunes playing on my AirPods, but I‚Äôm craving something different. My main playlist‚Äôs feeling a bit overplayed. Let‚Äôs try‚Ä¶ 2010 Throwbacks! Calvin Harris and Coldplay right out of the gate‚Äîhaha, perfect tunes for the ride home.\n\nToo bad I didn‚Äôt get very far. I passed this empty lot and had that familiar thought again: *This would be a great photo.* I‚Äôm so tired of that feeling‚Äîseeing potential shots and doing nothing about it. So I went against my grain (lately I‚Äôve just been letting them pass) and turned back.\n\nI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôd ‚Äúcall‚Äù the photo, but it spoke to me. So many layered elements: three levels of overpass architecture cutting through the sky, concrete columns falling perfectly on the thirds, the River Rock Casino landmark in the distance, and an abandoned lot in one of Richmond‚Äôs half-zoned industrial spaces. Littered with old mattresses, empty propane tanks, garbage, and the classic end-of-July special... drumroll... **blackberries**.\n\nBlackberries love abandoned places‚Äîthey know they can get away with growing wild. And I‚Äôll be there to take full advantage of those tasty (and not-so-little) treats.\n\nSee my 2024 post for the time I *almost accidentally sacrificed someone* to the thorny fate of a blackberry ravine.

    "fullContent": "I was at IKEA ordering some veggie dogs and an ice cream and overheard an old lady telling the cashiers at the grab and go food court that she just wants to order a coffee quickly and she has no idea how to use the self order machines. She was being super nice and not rude at all, but not to her luck, the food court workers wouldn't help her or even entertain her, just telling her to go use the machines. I felt really bad because the older lady was being so genuine and it kind of felt like one of those moments where she was really feeling out of place. I walked over to her and interrupted the conversation and asked if she would like me to help her with the self order machine. The look of relief on her face was more thanks than could be said with words.\n\nI really took my time showing her how it worked, and explaining each step in case she decided she wanted another coffee in the near future. I also told her about some common design flaws in the user flow in ordering that I come across often. I added a bit of humour in there to kind of lighten the stress because she was a bit flustered at the start.\n\nShe was truly thankful and she passed that onto me, all the good feelings.\n\nI know workers can't really leave their post behind the counter to help out everybody who doesn't understand how to use the machines. I mean, they are pretty easy. But if I put myself in the position of someone older who stays away from all the new tech that's exploding in our environments, I'd have to say it might be a mixture of being scared, frustrated, and just that feeling of \"I just want to talk to someone like I used to do my whole life.\"\n\nSometimes automation, shortcuts, and efficiency aren't the most accessible, even if they are intended to be.\n\nLike an alt tag on an image, an 'else' in case of the 'if' (JavaScript reference, please review), or a manual override, having a default or backup plan like actual workers still being able to take your order for those 2% of people that might need it is and should always be an option.",

Like a whirlwind of good feelings and memories.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I would always try to wake up first camping, crawling out of my nice warm, sleeping bag into that damp morning air, walking over to the fire pit, hoping that there would be some orange coals laying under a bed of white ash. I would stir around with a stick until I could find some. Using some old newspaper or whatever was laying around, I would blow on those coals to get the fire going again.\nIt was always so rewarding, making a new fire from the remains of an old one, like it was some camping victory, haha.\nThe first thing I would cook would be some toast. I love the way it would get toasted, leaving the grill marks of whatever we used on that camping trip. More often than not, there would be at least one section that was burnt. If you have gone camping, chances are you might know this flavor and taste.",

Seeing everybody around me, verbally complaining, and no one doing anything I decided to get up and let her know.\nI almost fell over an old log that washed up on the shore when I was jumping down to her (that would've been super embarrassing)\n\nI let her know the flashlight was on and she was super nice about it saying she had no idea (obviously she had no idea ahahahaha)\n\nI got a few \"attaboys\" out of approvals, which made me feel like ‚Äúmission accomplished‚Äù now sitting back down on my rock to enjoy the show with my kiddos!

They explained to me the things they wanted to do. And all of it was definitely the direction we were going. After we confirmed it all a few times they finally seemed like they're confident they knew where they were going.\n\nBut about five seconds before the doors closed, they ran out the door onto the station and jumped through the doors of the opposite direction train like a scene out of Indiana Jones.\n\nI couldn't help but actually laugh out loud, wondering if they were scared of me or if they were just super confused about where they were going. To this day I assume they are still lost somewhere in the Vancouver train network, hahaha.\n\nReflecting on the situation, I do remember how confused I was when I first came to the city. Constantly looking at the printed map on the walls. Frantically checking the digital display for the next stops. And now I'm numb to it all. Sometimes nodding off to sleep a little bit when I'm sleep deprived and somehow seamlessly waking up and becoming alert when it's my stop like I am on some internal clock. Who am I kidding? I think we all have an internal clock that is running us from the inside.\n\nSee future post for my thoughts on all the little things that are running us from the inside üòÇ",

There are signs saying it‚Äôs a leisure path and if you want to go fast, just use the bike lanes on the road (3m away).\n\nI noticed full racing road bikes, electric bikes, and even electric scooters, some pushing the 40km/h mark.\n\nIt was then I realized why that man was upset; he was sick of being bombed by every few minutes. On a leisure trail!\n\nIt‚Äôs really incredible that sometimes you are blind to your surroundings until something just clicks.\n\nAnd for anyone who read this far and is curious about my speed, it was 14 km/h üòá\n\nUnrelated... I see a lot of familiar faces each morning.

Have you ever seen something or had an interaction that made you smile just the tiniest amount, the corners of your mouth move just the faintest amount, and a quick wave of happiness washes over you? None of that lasts very long... or maybe it does! Regardless, that would be the feeling I‚Äôd expect from the little head nod üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è",

I almost wanted to open and close it a few times because of how satisfying the movement was. (Obviously, I didn't go ahead and do that.
